# Busybody Task List and Agent Instructions

## Task Batches Overview
This document outlines the parallel development batches for the Busybody project and instructions for starting multiple agents to work on them simultaneously.

## Starting Multiple Agents
To work on multiple batches in parallel:

1. Open multiple chat windows/instances
2. In each chat, use the task description provided below for the batch you want to work on

2. API endpoints depend on Database & Authentication
3. Testing depends on implemented features

## Recommended Startup Order

1. First Wave (can start immediately):
   - Frontend Infrastructure (Agent 1)
   - Backend Infrastructure (Agent 3)
   - Database & ORM (Agent 4)

2. Second Wave (start after first wave basics are ready):
   - Frontend Components (Agent 2)
   - Authentication System (Agent 5)
   - API Development (Agent 6)

3. Third Wave (start as features become available):
   - Testing Infrastructure (Agent 7)
   - DevOps & Deployment (Agent 8)
   - Documentation (Agent 9)

## Progress Tracking
Each agent maintains its own todo list and updates the central task tracking system. Progress can be monitored through the project dashboard.
