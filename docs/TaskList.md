# Busybody Task List and Agent Instructions

## Task Batches Overview
This document outlines the parallel development batches for the Busybody project and instructions for starting multiple agents to work on them simultaneously.

## Starting Multiple Agents
To work on multiple batches in parallel:

1. Open multiple chat windows/instances
2. In each chat, use the task description provided below for the batch you want to work on
3. The task descriptions are formatted to clearly define the scope and requirements for each batch

## Development Dependencies

Key dependencies between batches:
1. Frontend Components depend on Frontend Infrastructure
2. API endpoints depend on Database & Authentication
3. Testing depends on implemented features

## Recommended Startup Order

1. First Wave (can start immediately):
   - Frontend Infrastructure (Agent 1)
   - Backend Infrastructure (Agent 3)
   - Database & ORM (Agent 4)

2. Second Wave (start after first wave basics are ready):
   - Frontend Components (Agent 2)
   - Authentication System (Agent 5)
   - API Development (Agent 6)

3. Third Wave (start as features become available):
   - Testing Infrastructure (Agent 7)
   - DevOps & Deployment (Agent 8)
   - Documentation (Agent 9)

## Progress Tracking
Each agent maintains its own todo list and updates the central task tracking system. Progress can be monitored through the project dashboard.
